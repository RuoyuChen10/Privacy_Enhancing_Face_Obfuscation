## üõ†Ô∏è Environment

Please refer to MaskFaceGAN for environment setup: [https://github.com/MartinPernus/MaskFaceGAN](https://github.com/MartinPernus/MaskFaceGAN).

## üóùÔ∏è How to Run

After downloading the relevant files and installing the environment, run it directly, for example:

```python
python main2-v1.py
```

The relevant main files include: `main.py`, `main2-v1.py`, `main2.py`, `main3.py`, `main-age-race.py`, `main-race.py`.
